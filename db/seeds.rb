# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



# 1.times do |n|
#     name = "pudding"
#     price = 200
#     password = "password"

#     Products.create!(name: 'aaa',
#                  content: egg,
#                  password: password,
#                  password_confirmation: password,
#                  )
